			 <p><i>Good alumni relationships bring many benefits to both the<br>
			 institution and the alumni.Talented alumni will likely have a wealth<br> 
             of experience and skills to share with current students via talks and<br>
			 newsletters.In certain cases, this could go even further with alumni<br>
			 offering to practically support students in work placements and help<br>
			 them launch their careers.Peter Lock, Alumni Relations Officer at<br>
			 University told us:“Creating an engaged alumni network is beneficial for<br>
			 because engaged graduates are much more likely to want to “give back” to the<br> 
			 University; that could be, for example, by coming back and sharing their<br>
			 experiences with prospective and current students – there are no better<br>
			 ambassadors for your university than your alumni!”</i><p>
